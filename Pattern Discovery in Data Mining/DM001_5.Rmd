##001. Pattern Discovery in Data Mining
###Week2: Lecture 5. Mining Diverse Patterns

###Lecture 5.1: Mining Multi-Level Associations

Items often form hierarchies, to set the min-support thresolds:
* Uniform min-support: same min-support for all levels
* Level-reduced min-support: items at the lower level have lower support

Redundant rule: A rule is *redundant* if:
 * Support close to the expected value according to its 'ancestor' rule, and
 * Confidence is similar to its 'ancestor' rule.

Group-based 'individualized' min-support:
 * customeized min-support for different kinds of items

###Leture 5.2: Mining MultiDimensional Associations
 
Multi-dimensional rules (items in >= 2 dimensions or predicates):
 * Inter-dimension asscociation rules (no repated predicates)
   + age(X, '18-25') AND occupation(X, 'student') => buys(X, 'coke')
 * Hybrid-dimension association rules (repeated predicates)
   + age(X, '18-25') AND buys(X, 'popcorn')       => buys(X, 'coke')

Attributes:
 * Categorical attributes (no ordering among value)
   + data cube for inter-dimension association
 * Quantitative attributes (numeric, implicit ordering among value)
   + discretization (Lecture 5.3)
   + clustering
   + gradient approaches

###Leture 5.3:  Mining Quantitative Associations

Discretization (divide numerical attributes in groups)
 * Static discretization (based on pre-defined concept hierarchies)
   + Data cube-based aggregation
 * Dynamic discretization (based on data distribution)
 * Clustering (based on distance association)
   + First one-dimensional clustering, then association
 * Deviation analysis (if a subrules has an extraordinary behaviour)
   + *A subset of the population* => *Extraordinary behaviour of this subset*
   + the rule is accepted only if a statistical test shows significance difference

### Leture 5.4: Mining Negative Correlations
Rare patterns (very low support but interesting):
 * Setting individualized, group-based min-support thresholds for different groups of items

Negative patterns (negative corrleated):

> *Support-based definition*: 
> If itemsets A and B are both frequent but rarely occur together, 
> i.e.,sup(A U B) << sup (A) × sup(B)

But the above definition will not be correct when null transcations are dominant.

> *Kulczynski measure-based definition*: 
> If itemsets A and B are frequent but 
> (P(A|B) + P(B|A))/2 < є, where є is a negative pattern threshold, 
> then A and B are negatively correlated
