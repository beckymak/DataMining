###Week2: Lecture 5. Mining Diverse Patterns

###Lecture 5.1: Mining Multi-Level Associations

Items often form hierarchies, to set the min-support thresolds:
* Uniform min-support: same min-support for all levels
* Level-reduced min-support: items at the lower level have lower support

Redundant rule: A rule is *redundant* if:
 * Support close to the expected value according to its 'ancestor' rule, and
 * Confidence is similar to its 'ancestor' rule.

Group-based 'individualized' min-support:
 * customeized min-support for different kinds of items
